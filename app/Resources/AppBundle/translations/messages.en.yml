profieltekst: <p>I’m a freelance web developer focusing on backend technologies (PHP, MySQL, Doctrine…). I specialize in developing websites and web applications based on Symfony and other frameworks (e.g. Laravel) and content management systems (e.g. Drupal) that make use of Symfony’s components. While my focus is on the backend, I wouldn’t be able to call myself a <em>web developer</em> without a solid grasp of frontend tools like HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, templating…. Through professional experience (and curiosity, to be fair) I’ve also familiarized myself with Javascript frameworks like Angular and React.</p><p>The rapidly evolving world of web development is the perfect place to leverage my innate eagerness to learn. Keeping up with new practices and developments, enriching my skillset, learning to use new tools and frameworks... my day hasn’t been successful without having learnt something new.</p><p>I only work with reliable and open technologies that have become standard in the industry and embrace good coding practices. This way you can rest assured that your website runs fast and stable and will remain easy to maintain and update in the future.</p>

Migratie CMS Antwerp Museum App naar Drupal 8: Migration CMS Antwerp Museum App to Drupal 8
Laatste update: Last updated

'<strong>Bedankt!</strong> Ik neem zo snel mogelijk contact met je op.': "<strong>Thanks!</strong> I'll get back to you as soon as possible."

projecten.citysites: For Flow Pilots (Antwerp) I developed a platform geared towards Flemish municipal governments based on Drupal 8. The CMS allows municipal employees to manage services and the products offered by their municipality, as well as councils and their composition, sessions, agenda and decisions, alongside job offerings and news items.
projecten.ama: For Flow Pilots (Antwerp) I maintained and added new features to a 'headless' CMS based on Drupal 7 which serves as a backend for the Antwerp Museum App. Museums, tours and POIs are all managed from within the CMS, which delivers its data to the app by means of a custom JSON API.
projecten.mealplanner: A web application built with the Symfony framework that allows users to administer all their personal recipes in one central repository, create reusable menus on the fly, and generate their grocery lists from these menus and/or from individual recipes, ordered by department.
projecten.intranet: An intranet for the council employees of the municipality of Wemmel. The first version, launched in 2012, was based on Open Atrium 1, a Drupal 6 'distribution' aimed at improving collaboration and communication in teams. Apart from the built-in features, two custom features were developed (Telephone Book and Support Tickets). 2015 saw the upgrade to Open Atrium 2 and all content was migrated using a custom Migrate module. The upgrade to OA version 2.60 significantly improved the user experience. A new corporate design was introduced around the middle of 2016.
projecten.youthtube: A bilingual (Dutch-French) website aimed at promoting the annual Youth Day in Wemmel, launched in 2013 and 'reused' for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 editions. Originally written in 'plain' PHP coupled with a MySQL database, the source code was refactored within the Symfony framework in 2016. On top of that, the site layout became responsive and site editors were given the ability to create and edit content.
projecten.ama-d8: Take 15.000 nodes spread across 27 content types, 28 custom modules counting 26.400 lines of code, and 33 GB of media files and port them to Drupal 8, that was the ambitious goal of this project for Flow Pilots, Antwerp.
projecten.tartes: <br>A back-end for the new website of Belgian tart makers Les Tartes de Françoise based on Drupal 8. Thanks to the Paragraphs module editors are able to compose different types of complex pages by themselves. A separate front-end consumes data from het CMS via the JSON API.
